    "This homework will be intense. You can work on the scraping part of this homework during the TA session with Luis' help. The TA session will be there to help you - make good use of this and prepare a little before by doing step 2) before the TA session and then working on steps 3) following.\n",

    "2) Download the material for the homework and get the booking scrape code to run. Prove that you did by attaching a jupyter notebook. (this is only relevant for those who fail later steps)\n",

    "Design and implement a mini research project in which you research the effect of a big annual event in Barcelona on rental prices on booking by scraping data for at least two separate weeks (note that search results go across different pages) for Barcelona and at least one more city.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Identify an event that makes a lot people come to Barcelona.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Think of the time periods to scrape and what second city to scrape. Explain your choices in written.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Write down a fixed effects regression equation that allows you to derive a difference-in-difference estimate of the effect of the event on prices. Think of controls to add, why is this relevant? Explain why you need a second city for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Scrape using a modified code that implements a loop across pages of the booking page and searches for different dates and cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Discuss two additional ideas (no need to implement): a) the use of the text that can be scraped from the hotel/appartment description b) how to de-construct the treatment effect in the effect that comes from the same hotel changing prices and composition of places changing."
